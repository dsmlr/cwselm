    % FindAdjMatrix: Caculating adjacency matrix
    %
    % Input:
    %  X [dim x num_data] Input data.
    %  model [struct] obtained from svdd.m 
    %
    % Output:
    %  adjacent [num_data x num_data] 
    %     1 for connected, 0 for disconnected (violated), -1 (outliers, BSV)
    %
    % Description
    %	The Adjacency matrix between pairs of points whose images lie in
    %	or on the sphere in feature space. 
    %	(i.e. points that belongs to one of the clusters in the data space)
    %
    %	given a pair of data points that belong to different clusters,
    %	any path that connects them must exit from the sphere in feature
    %	space. Such a path contains a line segment of points y, such that:
    %	kdist2(y,model)>model.r.
    %	Checking the line segment is implemented by sampling a number of 
    %   points (10 points).
    %	
    %	BSVs are unclassfied by this procedure, since their feature space 
    %	images lie outside the enclosing sphere.( adjcent(bsv,others)=-1 )
